For our example, we are using a javascript based web application. This was
cloned from GitHub during the lab setup. 

[source,bash,run]
----
git -C clumsy-bird status
----
```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

From the above output, you can see that the clone has been successful
and there is a directory on the huild host called `+clumsy-bird+` that 
contains the source for the application.

Now, you will copy the full directory into the working container. 
The `buildah copy` command works the same as the `COPY` directive in a Containerfile.

[source,bash,run]
----
buildah copy ubi-working-container-1 clumsy-bird /var/www/html
----

At this point, all the software needed for the application is in the working
container. You can commit the working container to a new container image
called `+clumsy-bird+`.

[source,bash,run]
----
buildah commit ubi-working-container-1 clumsy-bird
----
