Next you will pull down our application content from github and position
it within the container image.

First, clone the application content from github. For our example, we
are using a javascript based web application.

[source,bash,run]
----
git clone https://github.com/ellisonleao/clumsy-bird
----

From the above output, you can see that the clone has been successful
and in the current directory, you should now see a directory called
`+clumsy-bird+` that contains the javascript based application.

Now, you will position this software within the container image you are
building.

[source,bash,run]
----
buildah copy ubi-working-container-1 clumsy-bird /var/www/html
----

At this point, all the software needed for the container is in the image
contents. You can commit hte working container to a new container image
called `+clumsy-bird+`.

[source,bash,run]
----
buildah commit ubi-working-container-1 clumsy-bird
----
