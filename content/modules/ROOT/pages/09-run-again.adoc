In the previous step, you committed your container image. You can look
at the images in local container storage by using
`+podman image list+`.

[source,bash,run]
----
podman image list
----

Now that the image is available, you can run the container. Because this
application is managed by a service, you will use the `+-d+` option to
run the container in a detatched mode. Additionally, you will map
traffic coming to port 8080 on the host system to be routed to the
application running on the container’s port 80.

[source,bash,run]
----
podman run -d -p 8080:80 clumsy-bird
----

You can now access the running `+clumsy-bird+` application by connecting
to the system’s port 8080.
