Now the software has been installed and a new container image created.
It is time to spawn a runtime of the container image and validate the
software. The software we are using is a commandline command. When you
`+run+` the container, it will be in interactive (`+-it+`) mode, based
on the `+moon-buggy+` container image, and the command run interactively
will be `+/usr/bin/moon-buggy+`.

[source,bash,run]
----
podman run -it moon-buggy /usr/bin/moon-buggy
----

You can now play the Moon Buggy game, which is a text-based version of
the popular Moon Patrol. When you are finished, use the `+q+` command to
quit the game, which will terminate the container.

Alternatively you can use `+podman+` to kill the running container from
*Terminal 2*.

[source,bash,run]
----
podman kill $(podman ps | grep -v CONTAINER | cut -f1 -d" " )
