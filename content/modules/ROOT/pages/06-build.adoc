Containers aren't just for making old software available on newer
OS versions. Containers are most often used to encapsulate unpackaged
software and it's dependencies as a single, transportable unit.

Buildah supports this workflow just as it does RPM packaged software.
Pull a RHEL 10 UBI image that you will target for your application.

[source,bash,run]
----
buildah from registry.access.redhat.com/ubi10/ubi
----

From the output above, you can see the image was successfully downloaded
and a working container image was created and attached to the system
with the name `+ubi-working-container-1+` You will use this working
container in the next steps to install additional software packages.
