In this step, you will install web server software to support the web
application you will position in the next step.

Our application is a typical NPM based web app. First, we'll install
Apache from RPM, like in previous exercises.

[source,bash,run]
----
buildah run ubi-working-container-1 -- dnf -y install httpd
----

Next, enable the httpd service so that when the container starts, Apache
will also start.

[source,bash,run]
----
buildah run ubi-working-container-1 -- systemctl enable httpd
----

Finally, configure the container to listen on port 80. Now the resulting
container will serve webpages as needed.

[source,bash,run]
----
buildah config --port 80 --cmd "/usr/sbin/init" ubi-working-container-1
----

In the next step, you will be pull the application directly from the GitHub
repo and install it in the container.
