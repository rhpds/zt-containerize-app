In this step, you will install web server software to support the web
application you will position in the next step.

Install the apache web server from the configured UBI software
repository.

[source,bash,run]
----
buildah run ubi-working-container-1 -- dnf -y install httpd
----

Next, enable the httpd service so that when the container starts, apache
will also start.

[source,bash,run]
----
buildah run ubi-working-container-1 -- systemctl enable httpd
----

Configure the container to listen on port 80 so that traffic being sent
to the container is being routed to the apache web server within the
container.

[source,bash,run]
----
buildah config --port 80 --cmd "/usr/sbin/init" ubi-working-container-1
----

In the next step, you will be positioning our github based application
content into the container.
