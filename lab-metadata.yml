lab:
  name: "Build container images with Red Hat Enterprise Linux container tools"
  shortname: "zt-containerize-app"
  maintainer: "Wilson Harris (wharris@redhat.com)" 
  
  description:
    summary: "Add an existing application to a Red Hat universal base image container and
  deploy it"
    goal: "After completing this scenario, users will be able to install additional
  software into a container image."
    concepts:
      - "Downloading a Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI)"
      - "Positioning or configuring a container to use 3rd party repositories"
      - "Install 3rd party software into the container image"
      - "Commit changes to create a new container image"
      - " Validate the containerized application"
    use_case: " You have a piece of software that you would like to deploy within a container
  image rather than installing it natively on the host system.  By using a
  container image, you can copy the entire environment for the software to
  several different hosts or run multiple copies of it on the same system."
